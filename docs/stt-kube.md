# Speech to Text Kubernetes

This page covers how to get the Speech to Text service running on OpenShift.

The files relating to this example can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/binnes/watson-libraries/tree/main/speech/stt_kube){: target=_blank}

## Deploy to OpenShift

1. Navigate to where the files from this repo have been cloned to your local machine and change to the speechi/stt_kube directory
2. Apply all the manifest files to your cluster

    ```shell
    oc apply -f <directory containing manifest files>
    ```

## Testing the deployment

To verify the service is running correctly the curl utility can be used to make requests of the service.  You need a test audio file.  One is provided in the stt_kube directory named **test.wav**.

*This was created on a MacOS system using the standard Voice Memos app.  Once a recording was made, select it in the **All Recordings** list, copy it (âŒ˜C) then paste it to the Desktop.  Use the [Convertio](https://convertio.co){: target=_blank} site, or similar, to convert the m4a file to a wav file.*

To test the speech to text container the curl utility can be used to submit requests, alter the URL to the route of the service on your cluster:

```shell
curl -k "https://stt-embed-demo-stt.apps.ocp.lab.home/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize" --header "Content-Type: audio/wav" --data-binary @test.wav
```

## Secure communication

The speech to text runtime container doesn't support TLS termination, only http.  The OpenShift Route enforces TLS termination, so all traffic coming into the cluster will be protected by TLS, but the traffic from the cluster ingress to the service will be unencrypted, which isn't ideal.  To solve this the watson-stt-haproxy container can be run in the same pod as the stt runtime.  The service and route can then be modified to sent traffic to the watson-stt-haproxy, which will then use *localhost* within the pod to send the traffic from the proxy into the stt runtime.

    Add the **watson-stt-haproxy** to the example deployment, service and route manifest files to enable internet -> pod fully encrypted traffic
